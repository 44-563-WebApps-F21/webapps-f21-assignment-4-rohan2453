<h4>Vera or, The Nihilists</h4>
<h6>A Russian Inn Large door opening on snowy landscape at back of stage</h6>
<h6>PETER </h6>
 <p>(_warming his hands at a stove_).</p>
 <p>Vera not come back yet,</p>
    <h6>Michael?</h6>
    <h6>MICH.</h6>
    <p>No, Father Peter, not yet; 'tis a good three miles to the post
    office, and she has to milk the cows besides, and that dun one is a rare
    plaguey creature for a wench to handle.</p>
    
    <h6>PETER.</h6>
    <p>Why didn't you go with her, you young fool? she'll never love you
    unless you are always at her heels; women like to be bothered.</p>
    
    <h6>MICH.</h6>
    <p> She says I bother her too much already, Father Peter, and I fear
    she'll never love me after all.</p>
    
    <h6>PETER.</h6>
    <p>Tut, tut, boy, why shouldn't she? you're young and wouldn't be
    ill-favoured either, had God or thy mother given thee another face.
    Aren't you one of Prince Maraloffski's gamekeepers; and haven't you got
    a good grass farm, and the best cow in the village? What more does a
    girl want?</p>
    
    <h6>MICH.</h6> 
    <p> Vera, Father Peter--</p>
    
    <h6>PETER.</h6>
    <p> Vera, my lad, has got too many ideas; I don't think much of ideas
    myself; I've got on well enough in life without 'em; why shouldn't my
    children? There's Dmitri! could have stayed here and kept the inn; many
    a young lad would have jumped at the offer in these hard times; but he,
    scatter-brained featherhead of a boy, must needs go off to Moscow to
    study the law! What does he want knowing about the law! let a man do his
    duty, say I, and no one will trouble him.</p>
    
    <h6>MICH.</h6>
    <p> Ay! but Father Peter, they say a good lawyer can break the law as
    often as he likes, and no one can say him nay.</p>
    
    <h6>PETER</h6>. 
    <p> is about all they are good for; and there he stays, and has
    not written a line to us for four months now--a good son that, eh?</p>
