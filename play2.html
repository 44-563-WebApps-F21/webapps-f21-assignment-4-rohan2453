<h6 class="name">MICH.</h6>
<p class="speech">Come, come, Father Peter, Dmitri's letters must have gone
astray--perhaps the new postman can't read; he looks stupid enough, and
Dmitri, why, he was the best fellow in the village. Do you remember how
he shot the bear at the barn in the great winter?</p>

<h6 class=name">PETER.</h6>
<p class="speech">Ay, it was a good shot; I never did a better myself.</p>

<h6 class="name">MICH.
<p class="speech"> And as for dancing, he tired out three fiddlers Christmas come two
years.</p>

<h6 class="name">PETER.</h6>
<p class="speech">Ay, ay, he was a merry lad. It is the girl that has the
seriousness--she goes about as solemn as a priest for days at a time.</p>

<h6 class="name">MICH.</h6> 
<p class= "speech">Vera is always thinking of others.</p>

<h6 class="name">PETER.</h6>
 <p class="speech">There is her mistake, boy. Let God and our Little Father look to
the world. It is none of my work to mend my neighbour's thatch. Why,
last winter old Michael was frozen to death in his sleigh in the
snowstorm, and his wife and children starved afterwards when the hard
times came; but what business was it of mine? I didn't make the world.
Let God and the Czar look to it. And then the blight came, and the black
plague with it, and the priests couldn't bury the people fast enough,
and they lay dead on the roads--men and women both. But what business
was it of mine? I didn't make the world. Let God and the Czar look to
it. Or two autumns ago, when the river overflowed on a sudden, and the
children's school was carried away and drowned every girl and boy in it.
I didn't make the world--let God and the Czar look to it.</p>
